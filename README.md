# Admin-Dashboard

For this project I'm going to lean on *Grid* principally, but I'm using *flexbox* where I think is more suitable for the job.

For the SVG icons I'll try to use the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements. I also align them with *flexbox*

For the profile part in the first div of the header I'll use *flexbox*, to ensure the user name will always be in one line and the search bar will stretch depending on this.
