# Admin-Dashboard

For this project I'm going to lean on Grid principally.

For the SVG icons I'll try to use the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. I also align them with flexbox

For the 2 divs in the header I'll use flexbox, to ensure the user name will always be in one line and the search bar will stretch depending on this.
